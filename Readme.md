# Learning React with Bob Ziroll

This repository serves as my learning companion as i delve into React with Bob Ziroll's guidance. It currently includes a foundational structure with the `main` branch acting as a starting point.

**Exploring through Branches (Coming Soon!)**

While the repository currently only has a main branch called `main` branch, future exploration involves creating additional sub-branches to:

* Organize my learning progress by topic or project.
* Experiment with different concepts and functionalities without affecting the main branch.

**How to Navigate Branches Available:**

To navigate to sub-branches, you can leverage Git commands to switch between them and explore your learning journey:

```bash
git checkout <branch_name>
