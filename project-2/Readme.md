# Learning React with Bob Ziroll

##Challenge
**Using CDN to implement my first react practise**
 
 I used cdn links to be able to implement react.

**Using jsx in react**

 JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It's a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript files in React applications.

## Project 2
**Locally setting up react on my machine**

I use the following command to locally craete react app.
 -- npm install 
 -- npx create-react-app my-app(app name) 
 --npm start
